## Background

Hello, I'm **Jon-Marc Redwood**, the founder of [Dressed to Kill Studios (DTK)](https://github.com/Dressed-to-Kill-Studios). I am primarily a game developer specializing in the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine) and releasing my creations on my [Itch.io page](https://karjon7.itch.io). Born in Jamaica and raised in Canada, I developed a passion for video games across all genres during my upbringing. In the midst of the pandemic in mid-2020, my curiosity about game development led me to embark on a self-taught coding journey. Over the years, I've honed my skills and achieved mastery proficiency in GDScript, alongside acquiring knowledge in other programming languages.

### Programming Languages

- GDScript (Very Proficient)
- Python (Proficient)
- HTML, CSS, JS (Intermediate)
- Lua (Intermediate)
- YAML (Intermediate)

## Projects

This section showcases the projects I've worked on.

### [Fully Armed Defense](https://github.com/Dressed-to-Kill-Studios/Fully-Armed-Defense) (DTK)

- **Description**: An engaging wave shooter where your mission is to protect the Harvester. Upgrade your character's abilities and weaponry to fend off increasingly challenging waves of enemies.
- **Development Period**: 2024-
- **Role**: Sole Developer

### [Banana Farmer Game](https://karjon7.itch.io/banana-farmer-game)

- **Description**: The Banana Farmer Game is a project that evolved through three distinct versions. Version 1 was crafted using HTML, CSS, and JS in VSCode, showcasing my early experimentation with game development. Version 2 was developed with GDevelop, further exploring different game development tools and workflows. Version 3, linked here, was created in the Godot Engine, representing the culmination of my learning journey up to that point. Regrettably, Versions 1 and 2 are now considered lost media, with only Version 3 surviving. Despite its potential, Version 3 never progressed beyond the alpha stage due to life circumstances intervening. Nonetheless, the Banana Farmer Game stands as a testament to my growth as a developer and the diverse paths my creative endeavors have taken, with hopes of a future remaster to honor my early game development journey.
- **Development Period**: 2020 - 2022
- **Role**: Sole Developer
- **Status**: Cancelled (2022)
