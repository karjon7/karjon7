## Background

Hello, I'm **Jon-Marc Redwood**, the founder of [Dressed to Kill Studios (DTK)](https://github.com/Dressed-to-Kill-Studios). I am primarily a game developer specializing in the [Godot Engine](https://github.com/godotengine). Born in Jamaica and raised in Canada, I developed a passion for video games across all genres during my upbringing. In the midst of the pandemic in mid-2020, my curiosity about game development led me to embark on a self-taught coding journey. Over the years, I've honed my skills and achieved mastery proficiency in GDScript, alongside acquiring knowledge in other programming languages.
